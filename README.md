## About

* “The Wild Oasis” is a small boutique hotel with 8
luxurious wooden cabins

* They need a custom-built application to manage
everything about the hotel: bookings, cabins
and guests


* This is the internal application used inside the
hotel to check in guests as they arrive


* They have nothing right now, so they also need
the API


* Later they will probably want a customer-facing
website as well, where customers will be able to
book stays, using the same API
