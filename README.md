## About

* “The Wild Oasis” is a small boutique hotel with 8
luxurious wooden cabins

* They need a custom-built application to manage
everything about the hotel: bookings, cabins
and guests

* Later they will probably want a customer-facing
website as well, where customers will be able to
book stays, using the same API
